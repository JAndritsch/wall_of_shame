Feature: Manging cars in the application
  As an angry developer
  I want to track all cars in the application
  So that I can see who our repeat offenders are
  And avoid assiging violations to company cars

  Scenario: Creating a new car
    Given this will fail because it is not implemented yet

  Scenario: Editing an existing car
    Given this will fail because it is not implemented yet
